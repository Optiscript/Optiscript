# Hi to everyone, I’m @Optiscript, a junior web developer ?
- I’m interested in web things like developing and servers (i have 9999 potato machines to run old linux distro (ubuntu was the goat at previous versions) and apache and xampp stuff. i love it) but also silly things like network's securities (wannabe ethcical hacker) (i'm definetelly bad at it)
- I’m currently learning how to use Linux (by the way i use Arch Linux <3), also programming (web languages : done !!!) (and now the holy C and C++ !), and networking (i love Ethernet! (difference between Internet and Ethernet is that Internet is a Wide Area Network (WAN), and Ethernet is only a LAN (more physical communication)!!!) (sorry for useless info)
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything (normally i don't have time but i would definitely love to do it)
- How to reach me : lemalvs@proton.me / optiscript@duck.com (personal email, maybe redirects and spam so there's less chances to get a reply) ; optiscript@proton.me ("professional" email (don't spam me please or i'll compile linux kernel on your computer) / higher chances to get a reply)
